# Summit Seeker

## Overview
Summit Seeker is a machine learning project that helps climbers determine the optimal path on a climbing wall from a photo input. This proof-of-concept (POC) demonstrates the feasibility of using computer vision and path-finding algorithms to assist climbers in planning their routes.

## Features
- **Image Recognition**: Identifies holds on a climbing wall from uploaded photos
- **Path Optimization**: Determines the most efficient climbing route based on difficulty preferences
- **Visualization**: Displays the suggested path overlaid on the original image

## Project Status
This project is currently in the proof-of-concept stage. The core functionality is being developed and tested with a limited dataset of climbing wall images.

## Installation
Clone the repository :
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aarensberg/summit-seeker.git
cd summit-seeker
```

Install dependencies :
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.11.9

## Usage
Coming soon! The application is still in early development.

## Data sources

- [Climbing wall images will be sourced from various climbing gyms and community contributions.](https://universe.roboflow.com/foad-ad5491-gmail-com/climbing-dataset-ekl0f/dataset/1)

## Roadmap
- [x] Initial repository setup
- [ ] Image preprocessing pipeline
- [ ] Hold detection model
